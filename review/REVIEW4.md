What is the problem with local maxima?

Many search spaces are not convex and have many local maxima. In optimization problems, search algorithms may not find the global maximum if they have poor initialization conditions and converge to a local maximum and not the most optimal solution. This leads to a solution being over-adapted/over-specialized to a local maxima. 

1. In the following diagram, each square has the same x,y,z axis. What might the names of those x,y,z values?
![](https://github.com/timm/sbse14/wiki/etc/img/landscape/WrightFitness.jpg)

x = length of hair
y = body weight
z = probability of winning fight

2. Explain the following, using the above diagram:

 * Holes
 * Poles
 * Saddles
 * Local minima
 * Flat
 * Brittle

3. Explain the following term and describe how it handles the problem of flat: Retries.

4. How does the following techniques avoid the problems of local maxima?

  Simulated annealing
    - Retries
    - Momentum (make sure you explain momentum)
  
5. Local search can be characterized as follows

   + Jump all around the hills
   + Sometimes, sitting still while rolling marbles left and right
   + Then taking one step along the direction where the marbles roll the furthest.
   + Go to 1.

In the following code snippet, explain where you'd find 5.
```
FOR i = 1 to max-tries DO
  solution = random assignment
  FOR j =1 to max-changes DO
    IF  score(solution) > threshold
        THEN  RETURN solution
    FI
    c = random part of solution 
    IF    p < random()
    THEN  change a random setting in c
    ELSE  change setting in c that maximizes score(solution) 
    FI
RETURN failure, best solution found
```

We did not make a submission to the tera-PROMISE Repository because we did not find any reusable data in any of our papers.

Most of the papers simply did not share the dataset they used. These papers tended to obtain their data from JIRA, but they did a lot of data mining on top of the raw data. Their networked data was not shared publicly.

A couple of the papers used data from Windows Vista, a closed-source software product. 

Finally, one paper used datasets from NASA which are already publicly available.

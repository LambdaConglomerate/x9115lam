\section*{Important Keywords}
\begin{description}
\item [{Organizational metrics}] Metrics designed to give a balanced view of organizational complexity with respect to software development. The authors argue that these metrics, as a measure of organizational structure, greatly affect product quality.
\item[{Failure-proneness}] The probability that a particular piece of software will fail in production. The authors hope to reduce this by incorporating organizational metrics into models.
\end{description}

\section*{Feature Extraction}
\begin{description}
\item[{Future Work}] The authors hope to replicate the study with other Microsoft projects as well as organizations outside of Microsoft. They have mentioned that they are already begun collaborating with the Fraunhofer research institute (pg. 10) for this purpose. The authors also hope to research open source teams and their "virtual organizations", global software development, and even the social and cognitive aspects of the engineers themselves.
\end{description}



\section*{Possible Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The phrasing in particular sections is grammatically incorrect. Here are a couple examples: "The deeper in the tree is the ownership the more focused the activities, communication, and responsibility" (pg. 4) and "The lower level is the ownership the better is the quality" (pg. 5). More editing should have been done to fix these errors.
\end{itemize}

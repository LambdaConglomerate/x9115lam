\section*{Important Keywords}
\begin{description}
\item [{Global development}] Development that is globally distributed but takes place within one company. The authors contrast this to \emph{outsourcing}, in which development takes place among multiple companies and \emph{collocated development}, where development takes place in one location. 
\item [{Coordination breakdown}] A difficulty usually encountered in distributed development where employees in one location are not appropriately aware or responsive to the work of employees in another location.
\item [{Binary distribution}] Different levels of classifications for where binaries are developed. The authors give \emph{building, cafeteria, campus, locality, continent, } and \emph{world} as different ways to classify binary distribution.
\item [{Organizational integration}] An organizational structure that spans geographical locations at low levels.

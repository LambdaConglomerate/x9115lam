We mean to implement PSO and then run it against all of the models that are in moeaProblems.pdf.  We will add a number of different heuristics to our PSO implementation.  One such heuristic we have discussed is using one particle as a predator and having it greedily chase the entire swarmâ€™s best known position while the rest of the swarm flees the predator.  We hope to implement   number of possible heuristics.

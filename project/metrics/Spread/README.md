How to run the spread calculator:
- Place the obtained pareto fronts in ./Obtained_PF (make sure you follow the nameing convention)
- Place the true pareto fronts in ./True_PF (make sure you follow the nameing convention)
- Run the script to obtain the spread of the obtained pareto frontier (python Spread.py)

Note: 
- The Naming Convention for obtained PFs(..files in Obtained_PF) is AlgorithmName_ModelName.txt for O
- The Naming Convention for true PFs(..files in True_PF) is ModelName.txt for O
